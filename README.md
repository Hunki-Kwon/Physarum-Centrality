# Physarum-Centrality
This includes the code files used for the analysis **"A Physarum Centrality Measure of the Human Brain Network"** - Kwon et al., 2019.

# Summary
From this code, network hubs and bridges were calculated in structural brain networks using the **Physarum model**, which used the optimal paths and fluid flow to formulate the **Physarum centrality** measure. A detailed description of all methods used in the paper is given in the Methods section of the manuscript.
